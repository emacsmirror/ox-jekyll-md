* Org Export Engine for Jekyll on Markdown

This is a simple org export engine for Jekyll Markdown.
It is built from the fabulous code provided by [[https://github.com/yoshinari-nomura/org-octopress][@yoshinari-nomura/org-octopress]].

Unlike the original code (and indeed most org-jekyll exporters) this exporter is built on top of ~ox-md~ to generate markdown.

** Major Changes & Features

More details on the development of this exporter can be found [[http://www.gonsie.com/blorg/ox-jekyll.html][on my blog]].

*** Date

The exporting of the ~#+DATE~ property (into the YAML front matter) is controlled by the ~date:~ option.
Today's date can be prepended to the filename with the option ~org-jekyll-use-todays-date~.

*** Tables

Table export is now implemented (rather than falling through to HTML export).
Valid kramdown tables are created, but they do not look pretty and cell widths are not even.
Org-table alignments are not currently implemented.
