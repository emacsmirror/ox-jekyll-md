* Org Export Engine for Jekyll on Markdown

This is a simple org export engine for Jekyll Markdown.
It is built from the fabulous code provided by [[https://github.com/yoshinari-nomura/org-octopress][@yoshinari-nomura/org-octopress]].

** Major Changes

Unlike the original code (and indeed most org-jekyll exporters) this exporter is built on top of ~ox-md~ to generate markdown.

The exporting of the ~#+DATE~ property (into the YAML front matter) is controlled by the ~date:~ option.
Today's date can be prepended to the filename with the option ~org-jekyll-use-todays-date~.

More details on the development of this exporter can be found [on my blog](http://www.gonsie.com/blorg/ox-jekyll.html).
